            <h2>dignity-first</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>dignity-first is an endeavour to support the vulnerable urban house-helps in this hour of crisis. A large number of them have lost their jobs due to the current situation. With their savings running out,their families are going hungry!</li>
              <li>My mission is to make sure that THEY DO NOT SLEEP HUNGRY.</li>
              <li>The aim is to do this by providing them an OPPORTUNITY TO EARN and feed their families with dignity.</li>
              <li>How it started - I got the idea after witnessing the scarcity of masks among the vulnerable poor and at the same time I have seen the plight of the househelps who are unable to travel and are unable to earn their livelihood. My idea provides them an opportunity to earn for supporting their families by stitching masks to slow down spread of the virus.</li>
              <li>I plan to reach out and attempt supporting the families of at least 15 such unemployed workers.</li>
              <li>DIGNITY OF LABOUR coupled with SAFETY!</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>ACT NOW, DONATE NOW </h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Your donation will help me PROVIDE A LIVELIHOOD to the urban poor who are most vulnerable.</li>
              <li>Your donation will enable me to provide them material and support to make masks. They EARN FOR EVERY MASK made.</li>
              <li>The donation money would be used to to procure the required material for masks & to pay the requisite making charges to the families.</li>
              <li>The masks that your donation will help make will be distributed free to the security & sanitation workers to slow down the spread of Coronavirus.</li>
              <li> Rs 1000/- donation would help feed a 4 member family (@ 125/- per day) for 4 days and help distribute 20 masks.</li>
              <li> Rs 5000/- donation would help feed a family (of 4 @ 125/- per day) for 20 days and help distribute 100 masks.</li>
              <li> Rs 10000/- donation would help feed 2 families (of 4 each @ 125/- day) for 20 days and help distribute 200 masks.</li>
              <li> Feeding a family for a month requires a donation of Rs 7500/- (and allows 75 masks distribution also)</li>
