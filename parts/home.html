            <h2>dignity-first</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>dignity-first is my endeavour to support the vulnerable urban domestic workers & daily wage earners in this hour of crisis. A large number of them have lost their jobs due to the current situation. With their savings running out,their families are going hungry!</li>
              <li>My mission is to make sure that THEY DO NOT SLEEP HUNGRY.</li>
              <li>The aim is to do this by providing them an OPPORTUNITY TO EARN and feed their families with dignity.</li>
              <li>How it started - I got the idea after witnessing the scarcity of masks among the vulnerable poor and at the same time I saw the plight of the domestic helpers (maids) who had lost jobs around me.My idea provides livelihood to the maids & their families and also helps slow down spread of the virus by distributing free masks among the urban poor.</li>
              <li>I now plan to reach out and support the families of at least 20 domestic workers / daily wage earners.</li>
              <li>DIGNITY OF LABOUR coupled with SAFETY!</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>ACT NOW, DONATE NOW </h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Your donation will help me PROVIDE A LIVELIHOOD to the urban poor who are most vulnerable.</li>
              <li>Your donation will enable me to provide them material and support to make masks. They EARN FOR EVERY MASK made.</li>
              <li>The donation money would be used to to procure the required material for masks & to pay the requisite making charges to the families.</li>
              <li>The masks that your donation will help make will be distributed free to the security & sanitation workers to slow down the spread of Coronavirus.</li>
              <li> Rs 1000/- donation would help feed a 4 member family (@ 125/- per day) for 4 days and help distribute 20 masks.</li>
              <li> Rs 5000/- donation would help feed a family (of 4 @ 125/- per day) for 20 days and help distribute 100 masks.</li>
              <li> Rs 10000/- donation would help feed 2 families (of 4 each @ 125/- day) for 20 days and help distribute 200 masks.</li>
              <li> Feeding a family for a month requires a donation of Rs 7500/- (and allows 75 masks distribution also)</li>
