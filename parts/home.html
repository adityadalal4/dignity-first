            <h2>dignity-first</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>dignity-first is an endeavour to support the vulnerable urban house-helps in this hour of crisis. A large number of them have lost their jobs due to the current situation. With their savings running out,their families are going hungry!</li>
              <li>My mission is to make sure that THEY DO NOT SLEEP HUNGRY.</li>
              <li>The aim is to do this by providing them an OPPORTUNITY TO EARN and feed their families with dignity.</li>
              <li>How it started - I got the idea after witnessing the scarcity of masks among the vulnerable poor and at the same time I have seen the plight of the househelps who are unable to travel and are unable to earn their livelihood. My idea provides them an opportunity to earn for supporting their families by stitching masks to slow down spread of the virus.</li>
              <li>I plan to reach out and attempt supporting the families of at least 15 such unemployed workers.</li>
              <li>DIGNITY OF LABOUR coupled with SAFETY!</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>your ACTIONS HELPED, THANK YOU </h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Your generous donations helped me in providing income support to 12 families.</li>
              <li>Your donations of over Rs 1.5 lacs enabled me to procure the mask material and also help them learn mask making through the support of a local tailor. </li>
              <li>We were able to make over 3000 masks and distributed them in the local community.</li>
              <li>As planned, the stitiching of masks allowed the workers to earn an income.</li>
              <li>You would be happy to know that with your donations, I was also able to provide PPE to a local government hospital.</li>
